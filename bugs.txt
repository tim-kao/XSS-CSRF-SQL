# XSS
The cross-site scripting essentially executes the embedded malicious script in the request, and the victim unexpectedly runs it.
In item-single.html, line 62 misuses a safe filter such that it allows variable director executable through javaScript.
To avoid the issue, we must understand director is unsafe, so we remove it and go back to escape data.

# CSRF
The original design allows anonymous to gift money to anyone, including themselves.
My solution is to verify the login information through checking User.objects.get(username=request.user.username)
if the exception happens, then the source is not verified, and we should reject the request.
On the other hand, if the source is verified, we can proceed with the gifting procedure and even deduct its account.

# SQL inject:
The code allows raw SQL directly passing into the database, and steal the administrator's password
through "signature": "' union select password from LegacySite_user where username='admin';-- %" in the card.
In order to fix the issue, I use parameterized queries again the attack.
from
    card_query = Card.objects.raw('select id from LegacySite_card where data = \'%s\'' % signature)
to
    card_query = Card.objects.raw('select id from LegacySite_card where data = %s', [signature])
